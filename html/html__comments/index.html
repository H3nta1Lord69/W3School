    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>
        <p>HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.</p>

    <h2>HTML Comment Tags</h2>
        <p>You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:</p>
        <!-- This is a comment -->
        <p>Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.</em></p>

        <p>With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:</p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <!-- This is a comment -->
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <!-- Remember to add more information here -->
        
        <p>Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search errors:</p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <!-- 
                Do not display this image at the moment
                <img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
             -->
