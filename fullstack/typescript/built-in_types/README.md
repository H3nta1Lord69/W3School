### List the built-in types in Javascript

There are also called the primitive types in Typescript

- **Number** type: It is used to represent number type values and represents double precision floating point values.

```
var variable_name: number;
```

- **String** type: It represents a sequence of characters stored as Unicode UTF-16 code. It is the same as Javascript primitive type.

```
var variable_name: string;
```

- **Boolean** type: In Typescript, it is used to represent a logical value. When we use the Boolean type, we get output only in true or false. It is also the same as Javascript primitive type.

```
var variable_name: boolean;
```

- **Null** type: It represents a null literal and it is not possible to directly reference the null type value itself.

```
var variable_name: number = null;
```

- **Undefined** type: It is the type of undefined literal. This type of built-in type is the sub-type of all the types.

```
var variable_name: number = undefined;
```
