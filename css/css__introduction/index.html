        <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, 
                layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
            </p>
                <code><pre>
                    body {
                        background-color: lightblue;
                    }
                        
                    h1 {
                        color: white;
                        text-align: center;
                    }
                        
                    p {
                        font-family: verdana;
                        font-size: 20px;
                    }
                </pre></code>

        <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
            <p>
                HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
            </p>
            <p>
                <h1><-h1>This is a heading<-/h1></h1>
            </p>
            <p>
                <p><-p>This is a paragraph.<-/p></p>
            </p>
            <p>
                When tags like <-font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, 
                it started a nightmare for web developers. 
                Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
            </p>

        <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
            <p>
                The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
